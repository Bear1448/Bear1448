# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub – @Bear1448  
*Mission Control for Code, Curiosity, and Veteran-Driven Problem-Solving!*

## 🚀 Who Am I?  
I’m Jacob Perry (He/Him), a former USAF Aerospace Ground Equipment Mechanic turned aspiring Software Engineer. I’ve swapped wrenches for code, but my military-honed problem-solving skills—think "fixing mission-critical gear under pressure"—still fuel me. Currently, I’m powering through a Bachelor’s in Computer Science (Applied) at OSU, with a parallel mission in cybersecurity certifications.  

I’m obsessed with:  
- 💻 Software development (especially embedded systems, controls, and full-stack solutions)  
- 🗃️ Databases that run like a precision-tuned jet engine  
- 🔒 Cybersecurity—securing digital frontiers like I secured airfields  

## 🎯 What I’m Up To  
- Transitioning my USAF expertise into software engineering, using my hands-on problem-solving to tackle complex coding challenges.  
- Always learning—whether it’s debugging a stubborn algorithm or exploring new tech horizons. I thrive on curiosity!  
- Targeting remote software development roles at Amazon, leveraging my veteran background and passion for impactful tech solutions.  

## 💡 Why Collaborate With Me?  
Think of me as your tech ops specialist:  
- I approach bugs like I approached broken equipment—analyze, adapt, and eliminate with military precision.  
- I bring discipline, resilience, and a "mission-first" mindset from my USAF days, perfect for Amazon’s high-impact environment.  
- I’m remote-ready, online frequently, and eager to dive into software development projects that align with Amazon’s veteran initiatives!  

## 🛠️ Let’s Connect  
- Reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-perry-66889437) to discuss remote Amazon veteran opportunities, projects, or tech chats.  
- Drop an issue here or ping me—I’m always up for a good problem-solving mission!  

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
Did you know I can troubleshoot a software glitch *and* a hydraulic pump failure? Multitasking is in my DNA!
